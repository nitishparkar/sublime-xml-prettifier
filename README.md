Sublime XML Prettifier
=============

A plugin to make my daily job a bit easy.
It uses ~~python's xml.dom.minidom~~ [XmlFormatter](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/XmlFormatter/) to prettify selected xml.
Select the xml and press ctrl + shift + f to prettify it.
(I have added Key Bindings for Linux)


You may have to follow the following steps to make the plugin work

    On Ubuntu 12.04, Python 2.6 isn't available, so here's what worked for me:

    Download python2.6 files from Ubuntu Archives
    Extract the files: dpkg-deb -x python2.6_2.6.5-1ubuntu6_i386.deb python2.6
    Copy the extracted usr/lib/python2.6 folder to {Sublime Text directory}/lib
