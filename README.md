Sublime XML Prettifier
=============

A plugin to help me understand xml response returned by external API by prettifying it. It uses toprettyxml() method of xml.dom.minidom to prettify selected xml. Select the xml and press ctrl + shift + f to prettify it (I have added Key Bindings for Linux). You can also select xml, right click and choose "Prettify XML" from the context menu.
